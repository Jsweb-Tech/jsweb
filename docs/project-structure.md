# Project Structure

When you create a new project with `jsweb new`, it generates a standard directory structure designed for scalability and organization. Understanding this structure is key to developing applications with JsWeb.

Here’s what a typical JsWeb project looks like:

```
myproject/
├── alembic/              # Database migration scripts
├── static/               # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
├── templates/            # Jinja2 templates
├── alembic.ini           # Alembic configuration
├── app.py                # Main application file
├── auth.py               # Authentication logic and routes
├── config.py             # Application configuration
├── forms.py              # Form definitions
├── models.py             # Database models
└── views.py              # Application views and routes
```

## Key Files and Directories

### `app.py`

This is the entry point of your application. It's where you create the main `JsWebApp` instance, register blueprints, and configure your application.

### `config.py`

This file contains all your application's configuration variables, such as the database URI, secret key, and other settings.

### `views.py`

This file is intended to hold your application's main views and routes. For larger applications, it's common to organize routes into separate files using blueprints.

### `auth.py`

This file contains the logic for user authentication, including registration, login, and logout routes. It's a good example of how to use blueprints to organize related functionality.

### `models.py`

This is where you define your SQLAlchemy database models. These models are used by Alembic to generate database migrations.

### `forms.py`

This file is where you define your application's forms using the built-in form library.

### `templates/`

This directory contains your HTML templates. JsWeb uses Jinja2 for templating, so you can use all of Jinja2's features, such as template inheritance, macros, and filters.

### `static/`

This directory is for your static assets, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. These files are served directly by the web server.

### `alembic/`

This directory contains the database migration scripts generated by Alembic. You shouldn't need to edit these files directly.

### `alembic.ini`

This is the configuration file for Alembic. It contains the settings that Alembic uses to connect to your database and manage migrations.
